2. Create an app, give it a name for example ci-ms4-elginis_restaurant, and select a region
3. Under resources search for postgres, and add a Postgres database to the app

Heroku Postgres

1. Note the DATABASE_URL, this can be set as an environment variable in Heroku and your local deployment(env.py)

2. Install the plugins dj-database-url and psycopg2-binary.

3. Run pip3 freeze > requirements.txt so both are added to the requirements.txt file

4. Create a Procfile with the text: web: gunicorn elginis_restuarant.wsgi:application for example

5. In the settings.py ensure the connection is to the Heroku postgres database

6. Ensure debug is set to false in the settings.py file

7. Add localhost/127.0.0.1, and elginisrestaurant.herokuapp.com to the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in settings.py

8. Run "python3 manage.py showmigrations" to check the status of the migrations

9. Run "python3 manage.py migrate" to migrate the database

10. Run "python3 manage.py createsuperuser" to create a super/admin user

11. Run "python3 manage.py loaddata categories.json" on the categories file in products/fixtures to create the categories

12. Run "python3 manage.py loaddata products.json" on the products file in products/fixtures to create the products

13. Install gunicorn and add it to the requirements.txt file using the command pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

14. From the CLI login to Heroku using the command heroku git:remote -a ci-ms4-elginisrestaurant

15. Disable collectstatic in Heroku before any code is pushed using the command heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 -a ci-ms4-elginisrestaurant

16. Push the code to Heroku using the command git push heroku master

17. Ensure the following environment variables are set in Heroku

18. Heroku Env variables

19. Connect the app to GitHub, and enable automatic deploys from main
Heroku Postgres

20. Click deploy to deploy your application to Heroku for the first time

21. Click on the link provided to access the application

22. If you encounter any issues accessing the build logs is a good way to troubleshoot the issue
